8,"Charlotte's Web is the most effective CBD product I have come across. I used this daily for an entire month for no other reason then to see if it would make a difference in my day to day life. What did it do? It made me feel so normal. Normal in the sense that my body and mind were ready to take on any task. I didn't have a single anxious thought or notice any pain in my entire body. It let my body do as it was intended, without all the variables of living in an advanced society getting in the way. It gave me a natural energy. It made me realize how important this stuff really is for human beings. It's a shame I've only recently discovered this. I can only imagine the wonders it could bring to someone terminally ill! The mint chocolate flavor was delicious and it was so easy to forget I had it under my tongue. Shame on the DEA for making this product unavailable for me at the moment.

I have acid reflux and constipation this almost immediately got things moving better there. It has taken the edge off of my anxiety quite a bit, and usually I have really bad insomnia I take Seroquel for that, last night I took my second dose before bed and slept so good!

They informed me that it is made to be safe for pets to use also, so I figured I'd try giving it to my 7 year old Lab Jonesy who has a few arthritis issues and he has responded astoundingly!!

18,"I tried another brand in the market and it was really oily and hard to swallow each day, it even clumps up in water because of the oil.  PuRx7 instantly dissolves in water and works really fast.  It tastes good also.  When I took it, I could feel it working within a few minutes rather than an hour.  I've been playing around with using a few drops vs a whole dropper full, and both work well.  The 85% absorption rate is a real thing.  I struggle with anxiety, and I got so used to not feeling the anxiety so much any more that I was thinking I didn't need the CBD until yesterday when I started feeling the anxiety I felt before I started using CBD.  I went and put a little PuRx7 under my tongue and within minutes I was feeling better.  Love PuRx7!!",5,3/15/2017 4:47 PM,hemp-cbd,hemp-oil,purx7-purx7-hemp-cbd-oil

Within 5 minutes I felt my tense jaw muscles noticeably unclench and my tense shoulders relaxed. I felt an overall state of calmness. So I would say it's working. Only thing is that I'm not sure if it was all ""in my head"" or if I'm ""truly"" relaxing. But, so far I would say that it works pretty good. I gave some to a friend who took the same 5 metered sprays and he also said he felt noticeably relaxed.

I can get through a boxing workout, which is something I haven't been able to do for a few years.  I seem to recover much faster from yard work and workouts- less soreness, fewer stiff joints.

First off I've never seen any other company with the quality of pills they use AND once I researched FULL SPECTRUM VS ISOLATE, I quickly realized why I was noticing such a difference. I'm taking 2 per day one in the morning and one before bed. You will notice the difference in quality compared to other products, I'm interested in trying some of their other products, hopefully they'll come out with more!

34,"I have been taking this product twice a day for about 3 months now and must say that it has done wonders for me. From the very first time taking this product I noticed that it made me feel way more focused on the task at hand (I was in the middle of writing a report). The general relaxing feeling yet alertness that accompanied this experience with the pills became almost therapeutic. Having add it's hard for me to stay focused at times and I have found that taking these pills help a ton! In addition to this and probably the main reason for taking them, my sleep has never been so good after taking this product! I work shift work and long hours which means that the quality of my sleep is poor. After taking these for the first week I noticed I woke up less irritable and had to nap way less.  Furthermore, as I weight train a few days a week, after I take these pills the soreness tends to go away faster or become more mild. Needless to say I'm a frequent buyer and recommend this product if your in need of a product that can improve your sleep quality, focus, and inflammation ( and the cinnamon taste is a nice touch too!).",5,4/11/2018 3:26 AM,hemp-cbd,hemp-oil,nature-leaf-organics-nature-leaf-organics-750mg-phytocannabidiol-softgel

My wife thought maybe she needed a little more.  Her experience was very simple: she felt like she didn't have a care in the world but didn't get sleepy or any head-high to speak of.  I, on the other hand, had a whole series of different experiences.  I'm very sensitive to meds of any sort.  So after one hour after taking my portion I began to feel the head-high starting.  This lasted for about 4 hours.  I had a nice comfortable feeling mixed with occasional forgetfulness. I would forget what tv show we were watching.  When I got up to make dinner, I had plenty of energy, but kept losing time or forgetting what I'd been doing.  After I ate we watched something funny on tv and I had more and more little trips where I noticed that I hadn't paid any attention to the tv show for a few minutes.  Kind of fun.  All in all a B- experience.  I slept well that night and woke up still feeling just a little dingy.  For me the experience lasted a little long and I had a few bouts of paranoia, but not enough to ruin the experience for me.

There was no cannabis taste, just a super clean, very effervescent soda which was carefully crafted for adult palettes in mind.  I was so impressed, I went and purchased several different flavors (at different doses) so I could see if there was a difference in flavor for higher THC %, but even at 100mg, there was no noticeable difference.

424,"This tea is hands-down my favorite weekday THC. I drink it every morning before work and enjoy a stress-free day without feeling high -- I can responsibly work while drinking my THC! Makes any day better, kills the anxiety from a crappy work day, and tastes/smells like regular yummy English Breakfast tea. Discreet and effective. Absolutely perfect for a case of the Mondays (and Tuesdays, and Wednesdays).",5,3/20/2017 7:45 PM,edibles,beverages,stillwater-brands-blissful-black-stillwater-tea

427,"I find infused beverages to be hit-or-miss, but Happy Apple is definitely a hit for me. This product doesn't sacrifice taste for potency or vice versa; the flavor is sweet and spicy, unimpeded by the addition of cannabis. Coasting into full-body bliss after about 30 minutes, this drink kept me fully immersed in my evening video games until tapering into sleepiness after a few hours. I'd tried Happy Apple over the summer as well -- the powerful but functional effects made for a very chill, very silly day at the lake. Highly recommend.",5,10/30/2017 6:06 PM,edibles,beverages,happy-apple-happy-apple
428,"I tried the 10mg and it was fantastic! It tastes kind of like a Martinelli's Apple Cider, which I love, and aside from a tiny bit of an aftertaste, there was none of that ""weed"" taste that I try to avoid when taking edibles.",5,6/27/2018 4:42 AM,edibles,beverages,happy-apple-happy-apple
429,It tasted a little bit weedier than the Root Beer but I am not complaining. The effects were spectacular. Drank half once in the afternoon and the rest before a night out in Vegas. Unreal.,5,11/24/2017 12:21 AM,edibles,beverages,dixie-half-and-half
430,"I used the 200mg version that delivers 12mg THC in a 15ml serving. I take it as a a nightcap for insomnia. The effects do take between 45-60 minutes.

433,"Just tried a little bit of this when a friend mixed up a capful in a mocktail of ginger ale and lime, and the taste was great, but way too spicy for my sensitive taste buds.

The flavor is really delicious, and it could go well in anything from a fizzy cannabis mocktail to topping on pancakes.

439,"Big fan of Craft Elixirs, but this one wasn't my favorite of their offerings. I thought it was a bit too mellow in the syrup and the coffee taste didn't quite feel authentic. Felt like a watered down version of a starbucks via, but then when I added more syrup, I didn't like that either... Hard to find the balance point.",3,3/30/2017 3:57 AM,edibles,beverages,craft-elixirs-bagley-ave-brew
440,Coffee and cannabis are two of my all time favorite things so this concoction is money! The easy dosing with the cap is awesome. It's so good on ice cream. 4 or 5 capfuls on top make for a nice nightcap.,5,4/5/2017 2:17 AM,edibles,beverages,craft-elixirs-bagley-ave-brew

444,"I purchased Ripple with a group of friends and made a shared dish - we portioned it out so each person had approximately 2.5mg (half of a packet per person) and it was the perfect amount for a mellow, enjoyable buzz that lasted for a few hours. Everyone still felt really functional - we made dinner, had some laughs and played card games. True to advertising, it was tasteless, odorless, completely undetectable in food. I would add it to any recipe or beverage. Great product - the whole group agreed they would definitely purchase again!",5,3/21/2017 3:25 PM,edibles,beverages,stillwater-brands-ripple-sativa
445,"I generally save edibles for special occasions. They usually take too long to kick in, or leave me feeling groggy the next morning. Ripple, on the other hand, had none of these side effects. I mixed one packet in tea, which kicked in within the hour, and felt like a mellow wine buzz. No clouds, no grogginess the next morning, and I slept GREAT.
